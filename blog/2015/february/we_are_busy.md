Even though it might seem like Ogitor development is quiet, it's not.

We are very busy in the hidden Team forum section where we are planning and developing the next major iteration of Ogitor SceneBuilder.

The next version is called *Ogitor 15.10 - aka 'Malazgirt'*.

*'Malazgirt'* is Turkish and is the name of the place where the great war between Turkey and Byzantium resulted in Anatolia being Turkish.
In other words: it means also 'beginning'.

We have decided to use the Ubuntu versioning scheme: year.month.

It doesn't look like much, and it doesn't do much at the moment.

But the magic lies in what's inside of it.

This time it is powered by the OGF (Ogitor Game Framework) which is component based, threaded and currently consist of 3 systems: geometry, graphics and input.
In addition to OGFCore, naturally.

In theory, this architecture would (hopefully) mean that the individual systems could be swapped out with something else.

Ogitor, the editor, actually boots and runs without loading any OGF systems, until a scene is loaded.

We are very excited to be developing a much better Ogitor!
We want the software to be a rock solid experience.
And that includes plugin development and scripting, which we are going to give extra careful attention.
Also, we are going to support OpenGEX for import/export - dotscene is not going to be supported by the core Ogitor team.

I almost forgot to mention that one of the biggest improvements to Ogitor will be a much improved terrain editor.
We are currently investigating different possibilities.

The Ogitor Game Framework can, and will be, used outside of the editor. And it will be developed in parallel to the Ogitor application.
